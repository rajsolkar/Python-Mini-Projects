    "2. Display all customers who are from the **UK**.\n",
    "3. List all orders with an amount greater than **500**.\n",
    "4. Show all shipping records that have a status of **‘Pending’**.\n",
    "5. Get a list of unique countries from which customers are registered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔗 **Joins (Customers + Orders + Shippings)**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Display each customer’s name along with the item(s) they ordered.\n",
    "7. Show all orders along with the customer’s country.\n",
    "8. Get the order details along with their **shipping status**.\n",
    "9. Retrieve all customers who have placed an order **and** have a shipping record.\n",
    "10. Show all customers who **have not placed any order** (use `LEFT JOIN`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 **Aggregations**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Find the **total amount spent** by each customer.\n",
    "12. Get the **average order amount** for customers from the **UK**.\n",
    "13. Count the number of **orders per customer**.\n",
    "14. Find the **maximum order amount** and the customer who made it.\n",
    "15. Get the **total revenue** (sum of all order amounts).\n",
